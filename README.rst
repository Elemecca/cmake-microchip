CMake for the Microchip Toolchain
#################################

This project provides toolchains and other support modules to enable
using `CMake`_ with the `Microchip compilers`_, although presently only
XC16 is supported.

.. _CMake: https://cmake.org/
.. _Microchip compilers: http://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers

Usage
=====

First, you need to somehow get a copy of this project as a subdirectory
of your project named ``external/cmake-microchip``. If you use git, the
easiest way is to add a submodule::

    git submodule add git://github.com/juanAngel/cmake-microchip.git external/cmake-microchip

Then add this snippet at the very top of your ``CMakeLists.txt``::

    # set up the Microchip cross toolchain
    set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE external/cmake-microchip/toolchain.cmake)

    # set the default MCU model
    set(MICROCHIP_MCU PIC24FJ32GB002)
This code fragment must be placed before "project" command to have effect

"MICROCHIP_MIN_HEAP_SIZE" sets the heap size

"MICROCHIP_MAP_FILE" allows you to generate a map file

The target MCU is set by the ``MICROCHIP_MCU`` variable. It can be set
in ``CMakeLists.txt`` as above or on the CMake command line like so::

    cmake -DMICROCHIP_MCU=PIC24FJ256GB004 .
    
You can set the variable "MICROCHIP_LINK_SCRIPT" to specify a linked script
