CMake for the Microchip Toolchain
#################################

This project provides toolchains and other support modules to enable
using `CMake`_ with the `Microchip compilers`_.

.. _CMake: https://cmake.org/
.. _Microchip compilers: http://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers

Usage
=====

First, you need to somehow get a copy of this project as a subdirectory
of your project named ``external/cmake-microchip``. If you use git, the
easiest way is to add a submodule::

    git submodule add git://github.com/Elemecca/cmake-microchip.git external/cmake-microchip

Then add this snippet at the very top of your ``CMakeLists.txt``::

    # set up the Microchip cross toolchain
    set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE external/cmake-microchip/toolchain.cmake)

    # set the default MCU model
    set(MICROCHIP_MCU PIC24FJ32GB002)

The target MCU is set by the ``MICROCHIP_MCU`` variable. It can be set
in ``CMakeLists.txt`` as above or on the CMake command line like so::

    cmake -DMICROCHIP_MCU=PIC24FJ256GB004 .

Copying

This project is provided under the same BSD 3-Clause license as
CMake itself. See ``COPYING.txt`` for details.
